## 1) EDA 
In the EDA notebook I used to read the data , make some statistical analysis to explore the logs
##
## 2) Embedding_and_modeling
In the Embedding_and_modeling notebook , there are several steps that we did :
 
- Split the data and make it balance ( between risky and not risky logs)
- Preporcess the data and clean it using spacy.
- Get Embedding for each preprocessed text
- Train 2 machine learning models ( Decision Tree and Random Forest) and pick the best model.
- Test the model with some new logs.
